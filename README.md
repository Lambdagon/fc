# INSTALL GUIDE,
Now, there areways to install the repository. The first one is quick and simple, but for me, it doesn't always work and likes to bring you back to the Github Desktop download. And the second one is slightly more complicated. Let's get to it!

# 1: The Quick, the Simple, and the Sometimes Doesn't Work

The first method has you go over to the right and click where it says "Code", it should drop some stuff down and then click "Open with Github Desktop".

ㅤ
It should open up Github Desktop and put you on this screen.

ㅤ
Set the "Local Path" with the directory to your sourcemods folder, mine is on the D drive, but yours could be different. After that, hit clone. Let it do it's thing, and once it's done you should see this:
