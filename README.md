# INSTALL GUIDE,
Now, there areways to install the repository. The first one is quick and simple, but for me, it doesn't always work and likes to bring you back to the Github Desktop download. And the second one is slightly more complicated. Let's get to it!

The first method has you go over to the right and click where it says "Code", it should drop some stuff down and then click "Open with Github Desktop".
